# Differential-Evolution-based-MPPT-with-Dual-Mutation-for-PV-Array-under-Partial-Shading-Condition.
<h1>Photovoltaic Electrical Circuit PROJECT</h1>
A project that uses differential evolution (DE)-based MPPT with dual mutation to track the maximum photovoltaic power under partial shading conditions. To be honest, this type of project is kinda out of the field of CS but I still find it really interesting and it may help us more in the future.
